# Point-of-sale Exercise

My solution for the Point-of-Sale exercise from World's Best Intro to TDD by J.B. Rainsberger (http://online-training.jbrains.ca/p/wbitdd-01).
It's an IntelliJ IDEA project.

The problem description can be found in http://online-training.jbrains.ca/courses/wbitdd-01/lectures/136762.
